What is pre-discovery?

[add updated overview image]

Before embarking on a partnership, CDS needs to make sure that the partner department and potential delivery team will be set up for success and have enabling conditions in place that let us do our best work together. A four-week pre-discovery is an opportunity to set the tone for a longer-term engagement, to learn from our users (public servants), and to figure out how we can best help them improve how services are delivered to Canadians.

Pre-discovery is dedicated to understanding how a potential partner department or agency works. While pre-discovery is designed to help us make a decision on whether or not to partner, it’s also an opportunity for us to help by listening, building trust and credibility, and providing advice and recommendations. It also helps us introduce the department to how we work, build buy-in and relationships with stakeholders, and generate awareness of the project within the department before it starts. All of this set us up better to achieve our mission of changing government to serve people better.

For our potential partners, it’s a glimpse into how we work. It’s an opportunity to learn how they might try something different, to deliver on their mandate, operational, or legislative commitments. It’s a chance for us to convince them that CDS might be a good fit for them too. 

It’s crucial to keep to the two-week time commitment. While it’s easy for both parties to want to extend the engagement, time is precious and we’ve got a lot of other potential partners that want/need support. Honoring the two-week commitment keeps everyone focused and the sense of urgency high. Keep in mind this is not a full Discovery.
